# portfolio-website-bootstrap

I declare that all of my work is my own. This repository is a heavily modified version of my previously submitted portfolio, in this version I have implemented Bootstrap as the main styling of the webpage and therefore I may have copied over some component templates from Bootstrap themselves.

# Welcome to my Portfolio

Welcome again to my Portfolio, but this time in Bootstrap, here I'll showcasing my web development skills through the website itself as well as projects I show off on the site.
This portfolio is mostly minimalistic and responsive and is currently a work in progress, I will populate the website with more content as the course progresses.

Please find my portfolio here:
